## Project-Euler Solutions

### About

My ongoing collection of JS solutions to the [Project-Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problem set. 

Helper functions I've created along the way can be found on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/project-euler-helpers). 

Questions and hashed answers found in project_euler.txt. Diagrams found in project_euler folder. These files were obtained from [local euler](http://kmkeen.com/local-euler/2008-07-16-07-33-00.html).

This is a WIP, many solutions are far from optimal/efficient. Refactoring as I go!

### Setup

To obtain the problem set/solutions/helpers locally:

```
git clone <this repo> <your repo>
npm i
```
To obtain just the helpers, follow the above link to npm.

### Usage

See project-euler-helpers documentation & code [here](https://github.com/MikeEngerer/project-euler-helpers).
